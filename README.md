## Introduction

Handwriting recognition is a challenging problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to implement different models and techniques to accurately recognize handwritten characters and digits.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the EMNIST dataset, which is an extension of the MNIST dataset and includes a larger variety of handwritten characters. For more information on the dataset, visit the [EMNIST GitHub page](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/EMNIST).

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Machine Learning**: Various ML algorithms are implemented.(KNN, SVM, Logistic regression, Decision Tree and CNN model)
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks are employed for recognition tasks.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
